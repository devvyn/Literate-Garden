# Aurora Suture // Polyphonic Sky Weaver

**Core Fantasy:** You are a skyward restorer, stitching auroral seams back together by conducting brushstrokes of light that respond to live audio input.

## Game Idea
- **Hook:** Paint constellations using responsive ribbons of light; each stroke harmonizes with ambient chords and mends tears in the sky.
- **Perspective & Feel:** Top-down zen puzzle with tactile brush mechanics, inspired by sumi-e painting meets audio-reactive shaders.
- **Signature Pattern:** Player rotates a loom of prisms to refract colors. Matching frequencies calms turbulent weather pockets.

## Suitability & Feasibility Outline
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Web prototype leverages Canvas 2D for particle ribbons; full build targets Unity with compute shaders for volumetric auroras.
  - Audio FFT drives color intensity; fallback sine-wave generator included for offline demo mode.
- **Gameplay Loop:**
  1. Survey the torn aurora segments while NPC observers describe folklore fragments.
  2. Select a frequency lane, rotate prisms, and paint a healing stitch.
  3. Harmonize three seams to unlock a sky story vignette; escalating turbulence adds new modulation rules.
- **Audience Appeal:**
  - Cozy puzzle fans + audio/visual artists seeking meditative interaction.
  - Strong festival photogenic factor; responsive sound-to-color mapping demos well on stage.

## Notes for Collaborators
