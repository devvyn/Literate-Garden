# AGENTS — Experiments Scope

Scope: `experiments/` directory and below. Root rules still apply; use these lane tips for demo subtrees.

## Breadcrumbs for Experiments
- Append an `Agent Breadcrumbs` section at the bottom of any doc you edit here with lane tag + intent.
- Keep collection-specific notes side-by-side (e.g., Bloom vs Clockwork) instead of merging them.
- When editing HTML/JS demos, prefer HTML comments `<!-- AGENT_TODO[...] -->` near the related widget.

## Collection Pointers
- **Bloom (Lane A/C)**: focus on instrumentation-ready hooks; tag with `AGENT_TODO[A]` or `AGENT_TODO[C]`.
- **Clockwork (Lane A/B)**: feasibility + governance breadcrumbs; tag with `AGENT_TODO[A]` or `AGENT_TODO[B]`.
- **Palimpsest (Lane D)**: narrative overlays; tag with `AGENT_TODO[D]`.
- **Patterns (Lane C)**: reusable mechanics; add SDK extraction cues.

## Merge-safe Practice
- Add new subsections rather than rewriting concept blurbs.
- If you need to retire a concept, mark it as "pruned" in-line instead of deleting text.
