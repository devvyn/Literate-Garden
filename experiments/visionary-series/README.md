## Budding Recommendations

### üåü HIGHEST PRIORITY: Tidal Echo Composer
**Why Bud Now:**
- Most unique selling proposition (tide-based music composition)
- Strong festival potential (Excellence in Audio at IGF)
- Clear market gap (no similar games exist)
- Audio-centric games underserved in indie space

**Critical Path:**
1. Secure composer collaboration (essential for full production)
2. Validate audio stem layering technology (1-2 day spike)
3. If successful, proceed to full prototype (6 weeks)

**Recommended Governance:** Scientific project with composer validation

---

### üå± STRONG CONTENDER: Memory Constellation Navigator
**Why Consider:**
- Lowest technical risk (proven technologies)
- Shortest timeline and budget
- Clear puzzle-game market fit
- VR expansion potential

**Next Steps:**
1. Build additional memory puzzles (expand from 1 to 5)
2. Playtest extensively for difficulty curve
3. Commission narrative fragments from writer

**Recommended Governance:** Spec-driven with narrative design docs

---

### üåø LONG-TERM POTENTIAL: Recursive Garden Architect
**Why Hold:**
- Highest technical complexity (fractal systems)
- Requires performance validation before full commit
- Educational/STEM potential needs exploration
- Could benefit from VR development trends

**Validation Needed:**
1. Stress test with 10,000+ instances
2. Measure frame times on target hardware (60fps?)
3. If performant, proceed; if not, simplify or hold

**Recommended Governance:** Scientific project with mathematics consultation

## Collaboration Opportunities

### For Composers
- **Tidal Echo** is IDEAL for composer collaboration
- **Memory Constellation** needs subtle ambient soundscapes
- **Recursive Garden** could use generative audio systems

### For Narrative Designers
- **Memory Constellation** needs 15-20 short narrative fragments
- **Tidal Echo** needs 15 poems/stories encoded in rock carvings
- **Recursive Garden** optional (purely contemplative)

### For Visual Artists
- **All three** need distinctive art direction
- **Tidal Echo**: Coastal environments, carved glyphs
- **Recursive Garden**: Fractal plants, organic aesthetics
- **Memory Constellation**: Nebulae, constellations, abstract imagery

### For Audio Programmers
- **Tidal Echo** REQUIRES audio programmer (stem mixing)
- **Memory Constellation** needs spatial audio implementation
- **Recursive Garden** could use scale-based audio (pitch shifts with zoom)

### For Game Designers
- **All three** need puzzle designers for full campaigns
- **Memory Constellation**: 20 memory puzzles
- **Recursive Garden**: Balance creative sandbox vs. challenge modes
- **Tidal Echo**: 15 coastal sections with increasing complexity

2. **Team availability:** Can we staff 2-3 person pods?
3. **Festival timing:** What's the priority deadline?
4. **Budget reality:** What's the actual available budget?

### Creative
5. **Tone preference:** More abstract or more narrative?
6. **Accessibility priority:** How important is mobile/touch support?
7. **Scope preference:** Shorter polished experience or longer campaign?

### Technical
8. **Platform targets:** Web-first, then desktop? Or desktop-only?
9. **VR interest:** Should any of these prioritize VR?
10. **Multiplayer:** Any appetite for social/shared experiences?

## Integration with Literate Garden

These concepts fit the **Garden philosophy**:
- ‚úÖ **Playable, not perfect** ‚Äî All demos interactive, not polished
- ‚úÖ **Rapid prototyping** ‚Äî Built in single session
- ‚úÖ **Budding candidates** ‚Äî Ready to graduate to dedicated repos
- ‚úÖ **Provenance tracking** ‚Äî Clear creation date and rationale

### Budding Pathway
When ready to graduate:
1. Create dedicated repository
2. Extract prototype as foundation
3. Set up appropriate governance (spec-driven/library/scientific)
4. Coordinate via meta-project bridge
5. Document budding in garden
