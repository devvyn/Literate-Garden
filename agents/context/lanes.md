# Context Nodes — Parallel Lanes (Iteration A)

These context nodes summarize intent for the four simultaneous lanes. Expand with sibling files for new lanes or deeper dives.

## Lane A — Telemetry & Gallery
- Goal: Instrument marimo/gallery surfaces to capture playability signals and surface them inline.
- Handholds: `game_demos_gallery.py`, `demo_browser.html`, marimo UI tabs.
- AGENT_TODO[A]: Draft lightweight event schema and iframe embedding checklist.

## Lane B — Budding & Governance
- Goal: Prepare extraction playbooks and repo handoff templates without blocking experimentation.
- Handholds: `BUDDING_GUIDE.md`, README budding notes, new governance snippets.
- AGENT_TODO[B]: Add graduation checklist snippet that can be copy/pasted into new buds.

## Lane C — Pattern SDK
- Goal: Turn repeatable mechanics into sharable modules and document rendering hooks.
- Handholds: `experiments/patterns/`, `grand-catalogue-gallery.html`.
- AGENT_TODO[C]: Identify top 2 assets to templatize; leave breadcrumbs in patterns docs.

## Lane D — Narrative Layering
- Goal: Explore timeline overlays, diegetic journaling, and memory mechanics.
- Handholds: `experiments/palimpsest/`, `starter_seed.py` narrative cells.
- AGENT_TODO[D]: Sketch minimal marimo cell capturing layered timeline concept.

## Agent Breadcrumbs (Lane D — Narrative Layering)
- 2025-10-06: Initialized context node map for all four lanes; left TODO hooks for lane specialists to claim.
