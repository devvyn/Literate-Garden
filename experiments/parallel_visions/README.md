# 🌌 Parallel Visions Showcase

> **Role Reminder:** Esteemed indie game developer + technical visionary designing four parallel demo concepts.
>
> **Coordination Note:** Inline HTML comments flag collaboration hooks. Look for `<!-- next:` markers.

This directory collects **four distinct demo versions** explored in parallel. Each version pairs a visionary pitch with feasibility notes and a lightweight web artefact that Marimo can surface.

## Directory Map

- `aurora_suture/` — Aurora restoration puzzle built around brushstroke weaving.
- `coral_wake/` — Sail-driven strategy loop balancing a living archipelago.
- `monument_echo/` — Memory archaeology with timeline lenses.
- `solstice_run/` — Solar-ritual runner emphasizing rhythm and light routing.
- `gallery.py` — Marimo notebook wiring the four explorations together.

## Collaboration Ledger

- ✅ Concepts + feasibility captured for all four branches.
- ✅ Web artefacts compiled (HTML/CSS/JS) for Marimo embedding.
- ⚠️ Future work hooks flagged inline per branch for deeper simulation.

<!-- next: Extend gallery with analytics overlays once prototype metrics exist. -->
