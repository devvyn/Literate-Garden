# Dream Demos Portfolio

> *An ideation slate capturing high-concept prototypes that could headline an indie showcase.*

<!-- COLLAB NOTE: Extend this document with additional feasibility assessments or tie-ins to production milestones. -->

## Evaluation Framework
- **Suitability**: How strongly the demo aligns with a high-impact festival or award showcase.
- **Feasibility**: A candid look at production lift, tooling dependencies, and timeline risk.
- **Audience Hook**: Elevator pitch for judges and press.

## Demo Shortlist

### 1. *Lighthouse Palimpsest*
- **Premise**: A memory-forging narrative where players rotate a brass lighthouse to layer timelines and solve spectral cartography puzzles.
- **Core Loop**:
  1. Align the lighthouse lenses to project overlapping eras.
  2. Decode ghostly annotations to unlock forgotten sea routes.
  3. Preserve or rewrite history to rescue shipwrecked crews.
- **Suitability**: 🌟🌟🌟🌟 — Atmospheric, narrative-forward demos consistently resonate at IGF and Day of the Devs.
- **Feasibility**: ⚙️⚙️ — Requires custom shader work for layered projections but art scope is controllable with stylized assets.
- **Audience Hook**: "What if you could rotate a lighthouse and literally change the past to save lost mariners?"

### 2. *MetroMycelium*
- **Premise**: A bioluminescent transit sim where fungal networks replace subway lines beneath a neon eco-city.
- **Core Loop**:
  1. Cultivate mycelial routes to balance commuter flow.
  2. Respond to environmental stressors (drought, pollution, festivals).
  3. Harvest narrative snippets from commuters who co-create the network.
- **Suitability**: 🌟🌟🌟 — Systems-forward yet visually unique; strong fit for experimental showcases.
- **Feasibility**: ⚙️⚙️⚙️ — Needs performant pathfinding and reactive storytelling; prototyping possible in Godot with tile-based graphs.
- **Audience Hook**: "Grow a glowing subway under the city, and the riders tell the story back to you."

### 3. *Echoes of Laurel Vault*
- **Premise**: Rhythm-combat meets botanical caretaking; each beat sprouts defenses in an ancient arboretum.
- **Core Loop**:
  1. Sync percussion patterns with enemy waves.
  2. Plant defensive flora that harmonize with the beat.
  3. Unlock lore fragments through perfect sequences.
- **Suitability**: 🌟🌟🌟🌟 — Hybrid of rhythm and strategy is media-friendly and demo-able in 10-minute slots.
- **Feasibility**: ⚙️⚙️ — Requires polished audio pipeline but limited level scope keeps production manageable.
- **Audience Hook**: "Conduct a living symphony where every chord blossoms into protection."

### 4. *Perihelion Postcards*
- **Premise**: A meditative delivery game; players chart micro-shuttles to handwrite letters at the solar system's edge.
- **Core Loop**:
  1. Plot gravity-assisted routes between dwarf planets.
  2. Craft letters informed by recipients' emotional states.
  3. Photograph cosmic vistas for keepsake postcards.
- **Suitability**: 🌟🌟 — Chill, cozy tone fits narrative showcases though pacing may be slow for stage demos.
- **Feasibility**: ⚙️⚙️⚙️ — Astrodynamics UI/UX is a heavy lift; would benefit from dedicated simulation support.
- **Audience Hook**: "The loneliest corners of space receive handwritten warmth thanks to your delivery artistry."

## Pattern Candidates for Web Artefacts
- **Diegetic Control Surfaces** *(Lighthouse Palimpsest)*: Interfaces presented as in-world objects.
- **Organic Transit Topologies** *(MetroMycelium)*: Graph structures that grow in response to player choices.
- **Synesthetic Feedback Loops** *(Echoes of Laurel Vault)*: Harmonizing audio, color, and mechanics.

## Follow-up Seeds
- Prototype shader briefs for Lighthouse Palimpsest using WebGL or Three.js.
- Draft commuter vignette generator for MetroMycelium (Mad Libs style) to test tone.
- Commission audio sketch or midi baseline for Echoes to validate rhythm mechanics.
