# Literate Garden - Agent Instructions

**What this is**: A marimo playground for interactive experiments.

**What this isn't**: A production system, a spec-driven project, or a governance framework.

## Working Here

Run experiments:
```bash
marimo run <notebook>.py      # view
marimo edit <notebook>.py     # hack
```

Create experiments:
```bash
# Just make a .py file with marimo cells. No templates needed.
```

Tools: `uv` for packages, `fd` for files, `rg` for search.

## Active Experiments

| Notebook | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `agent_strata.py` | Layered agent architecture proof-of-concept |
| `game_demos_gallery.py` | Interactive game concept showcase |
| `build_greene_graph.py` | Robert Greene influence mapping |
| `kubernetes_operators_exploration.py` | K8s operator patterns (research) |
| `protracker_deep_dive.py` | MOD/tracker music analysis (research) |

## When to escalate

- To human: Domain expertise needed, strategic priority conflicts
- To Chat agent: Pattern recognition across portfolio, when something should become its own repo

That's it. Make things. Run them. Move on.
