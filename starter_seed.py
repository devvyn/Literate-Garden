"""starter_seed.py

A marimo "seed" for agentic, self-incubating projects with hooks for
Codex-style agents.

This document is both narrative and executable. Its purpose is to:
  1. Declare the project’s purpose and working style
  2. Establish a reproducible environment
  3. Encode the agentic loop of "observe → reflect → extend"
  4. Generate tasks and notes that become future iterations

    # 🌱 Agentic Project Seed

    Welcome! This is a self-incubating marimo document designed to be
    the genesis of a project. Think of it as a seed crystal dropped
    into solution: over time, structures will accrete, iterate, and 
    self-improve.
    
    ## Principles
    - Literate programming: code and commentary in one.
    - Agentic growth: the system proposes its own next steps.
    - Self-documenting: outputs are logged as part of the narrative.
    
    Begin by running this document. Each cycle produces:
    1. Reflections on the current state
    2. A prioritized task list
    3. Hooks for external agents (e.g. Codex) to act
