# Solstice Run // Radiant Rhythm Courier

**Core Fantasy:** Sprint across a kinetic desert city, choreographing solar mirrors and percussion gates to deliver light before the night swallows the celebration.

## Game Idea
- **Hook:** Parkour runner meets rhythm conductor; align beats to channel sunlight through alleys and power community rituals.
- **Perspective & Feel:** Third-person kinetic runner with cel-shaded flair, heavy emphasis on rhythmic timing.
- **Signature Pattern:** A dynamic lane system where players swap between mirror routes; chaining perfect rhythms creates aurora-like burst boosts.

## Suitability & Feasibility Outline
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Browser demo uses Canvas parallax layers + WebAudio metronome; full build targets Unreal with Control Rig for traversal setpieces.
  - Input latency compensation included via adjustable offset slider for rhythm accuracy.
- **Gameplay Loop:**
  1. Calibrate beat, preview route hazards.
  2. Sprint + time jumps/reflectors to maintain solar charge.
  3. Deliver light to plazas; spend earned resonance on new abilities/routes.
- **Audience Appeal:**
  - Fans of Sayonara Wild Hearts, Runner3, and mirror's edge-likes.
  - Competitive community potential via asynchronous leaderboards.
