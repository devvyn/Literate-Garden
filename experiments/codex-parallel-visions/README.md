## Known Blockers

### Set 1: Narrative Quartet
- Need to review demos to understand full mechanics
- Some concepts may need clearer design docs
- **Next:** Play through all demos, document findings

### Set 2: Abstract Quartet
- Concepts not yet named (version labels only)
- Need to analyze demos to extract themes
- **Next:** Explore demos, create descriptive names

### Set 3: Genre-Bending Visions
- Complex multi-system designs may need scoping
- Quantum mechanics gameplay needs prototyping validation
- **Next:** Assess technical feasibility for each

### Set 4: Conceptual Experiments
- High-concept ideas may need accessibility work
- Some overlap with existing concepts (constellation themes)
- **Next:** Identify unique angles vs. existing concepts
