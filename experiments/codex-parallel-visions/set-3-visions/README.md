# 🌈 Parallel Visions Showcase

Four experimental directions captured in parallel to demonstrate creative range and technical readiness. Each version ships with a web-ready sketch plus production notes for quick collaboration.

## Versions

1. **Version A · Solarpunk Harmonics** (`version_a_solarpunk/web/index.html`)
   - Synesthetic gardening sim with slider-driven canvas animation.
   - Highlights accessibility-first presentation and audio-responsive loops.

2. **Version B · Quantum Relay Heist** (`version_b_quantum_heist/web/index.html`)
   - Neon tactics puzzle exploring dual-timeline planning.
   - Grid interaction demonstrates deterministic loop and communicates blockers.

3. **Version C · Mycelial Memory Opera** (`version_c_mycelial_opera/web/index.html`)
   - Narrative choral experience with node-based memory weaving.
   - Canvas graph + collaborative notes for future lighting/audio passes.

4. **Version D · Cloudforged Ritual** (`version_d_cloudforged_ritual/web/index.html`)
   - Co-op ritual strategy featuring drag-and-drop layout planning.
   - Forecast logic teases systemic weather interactions.

## Collaboration Signals

- Inline HTML comments call out context for asynchronous contributors.
- Dead-end / blocker annotations identify next decision points.
- Each sketch is Marimo-embeddable via iframe or static HTML inclusion.

## Next Steps

- Integrate these four visions into a dedicated marimo document for unified playback.
- Pair with sound/art pipelines according to blockers noted per version.
- Consider bridging select mechanics into the existing `game_demos_gallery.py` once vetted.
