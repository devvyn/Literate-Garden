# Monument Echo // Resonant Memory Labyrinth

**Core Fantasy:** Explore a colossal shifting monument where each floor holds memories of a vanished civilization; tune resonance lenses to align timelines and reveal truths.

## Game Idea
- **Hook:** Rotate temporal lenses to phase between past, present, and speculative futures, uncovering the true narrative stitched between echoes.
- **Perspective & Feel:** First-person narrative puzzler with environmental storytelling, delivered through diegetic instruments and choral cues.
- **Signature Pattern:** A resonance dial acts as a timeline scrubber; aligning harmonics stabilizes structures and opens new paths.

## Suitability & Feasibility Outline
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Web mockup relies on CSS 3D transforms + GSAP-like tweening via minimal vanilla JS.
  - Full slice targets Unreal 5 for lumen-powered lighting and spatial audio, with modular narrative data graphs.
- **Gameplay Loop:**
  1. Enter a chamber, scan for echo residues (visual + audio).
  2. Adjust resonance dial to reveal layered architecture.
  3. Solve spatial puzzles to collect memory shards, unlocking archival monologues.
- **Audience Appeal:**
  - Narrative adventure fans, festival juries valuing experimental storytelling, VR adaptation potential.
  - Strong cross-media tie-ins (podcast, gallery installations).

## Notes for Collaborators
- Timeline alignment math documented inline within `web/index.html` for quick porting to engines.
