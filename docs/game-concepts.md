# Dream Demo Portfolio

> Collaboration Beacon: This document is the canonical guide for our concept slate. Extend sections using the same heading structure, and annotate new contributions with `Contributor:` comments so others can trace ownership.

## Concept 1: Chrono Bloom Conservatory
- **Core Fantasy**: A living botanical timepiece where flora respond to temporal puzzles and music-based growth cues.
- **Signature Mechanic**: Players conduct a symphony of seasons, scrubbing time forward/backward to orchestrate plant evolution.
- **Feasibility Snapshot**:
  - Suitability: Ideal for narrative puzzle showcases and award circuits celebrating synesthetic mechanics.
  - Technical Lift: Requires spline-based plant animation and lightweight audio-reactive shaders. Unreal or Unity timeline tools fit perfectly.
  - Production Rhythm: Vertical slice achievable in 8-10 weeks with 3-person pod.
- **Demo Hook**: Interactive terrarium with three timed growth challenges and adaptive music loops.

## Concept 2: Luminous Threadbreakers
- **Core Fantasy**: Rogue-weaver heroes stitching constellations to mend a fractured night sky.
- **Signature Mechanic**: Thread-slingshot traversal that knots patterns into enemy weaknesses while reweaving celestial maps.
- **Feasibility Snapshot**:
  - Suitability: Marries tactile traversal and pattern-matching—strong candidate for festivals seeking kinetic artistry.
  - Technical Lift: Prototype via Godot's rope physics and signed-distance-field rendering. UI overlays for pattern goals.
  - Production Rhythm: Functional web demo ready in 6 weeks; full console pitch in 4 months.
- **Demo Hook**: Timed constellation rescue with leaderboard-backed pattern efficiency scoring.

## Concept 3: Emberwake Courier Guild
- **Core Fantasy**: Ember-powered courier racing across volcanic archipelagos to deliver stories before they fade.
- **Signature Mechanic**: Momentum surfing over magma jets, chaining deliveries to keep narrative embers alight.
- **Feasibility Snapshot**:
  - Suitability: Blends momentum puzzles with emotional cargo—tailor-made for narrative + mechanics award tracks.
  - Technical Lift: Unity-based spline racing with heat-haze post-processing; narrative cards delivered through VO snippets.
  - Production Rhythm: Greybox track and delivery logic in 4 weeks; stylized art pass in 6 additional weeks.
- **Demo Hook**: Split-route challenge where players juggle cargo stability and branching narrative timers.

### Dormant Sparks / Blockers Log
- *2024-05-16*: Paused on "Tideglass Archivist" pitch after realizing archival deckbuilding overlapped with an ongoing collab. Leaving reference sketches in `/reference/tideglass` once cleared for sharing.
- *2024-05-16*: Holding on water rendering R&D until the shared shader library is synced from the graphics team.

<!-- Collaboration Note: Update the blockers log when picking up or resolving a dormant idea. -->
