# Coral Wake Caravan // Living Trade Winds

**Core Fantasy:** Command a flotilla of biomechanical sail-creatures, shepherding stories and resources across a sentient reef archipelago that remembers every choice.

## Game Idea
- **Hook:** Each trading route reshapes coral formations; the sea literally blooms in response to sustainable choices, or recoils when overharvested.
- **Perspective & Feel:** Isometric strategy blended with cozy resource management, infused with musical wind cues.
- **Signature Pattern:** A tide clock and empathy meter ensure every delivery is a negotiation between ecology and ambition.

## Suitability & Feasibility Outline
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Browser demo uses SVG morphing + WebAudio windscapes; full version aims for Godot 4 with fluid-sim shaders.
  - AI narration system logs player routes; initial stub uses weighted random lore fragments.
- **Gameplay Loop:**
  1. Chart a route by aligning sails to prevailing coral-sent signals.
  2. Deliver stories/resources, negotiating with reef avatars.
  3. React to ecological feedback, upgrade fleet, unlock deeper passages.
- **Audience Appeal:**
  - Fans of Sunless Sea, Dorfromantik, and eco-conscious sims.
  - Streamer-friendly emergent storytelling; strong educational partnerships potential.

## Notes for Collaborators
- Trade balance spreadsheet stub lives in `web/index.html` comments for future tuning.
- <!-- next: Implement asynchronous backend hook for persistent archipelago state once demo proves retention. -->
